On https://bazel.build/install/compile-source they say
"You should verify the signature made by Bazel's release key 3D5919B448457EE0"

I've downloaded the key [3D5919B448457EE0] from their link and named it as
bazelPubKey.pem:

    curl -L -o bazelPubKey.pem https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg


[3D5919B448457EE0]: https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg
